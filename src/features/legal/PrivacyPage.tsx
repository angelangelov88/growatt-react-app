      This notice explains what personal data Kelpwatt ({SITE}) collects, why,
      who it&apos;s shared with and the rights you have. In short: we collect
      only what the app needs to work, we never sell it or use it for
      advertising, and you can download or delete it at any time from Settings.

    <LegalSection title="Who we are">

        Kelpwatt is a personal, non-commercial project run by {OPERATOR}, who is
        the data controller for the personal data described here. For any

          address and your password (stored only as a secure hash by our login
          provider; we never see it). If you sign in with Google, Google shares
          your name, email address, profile picture link and Google account ID.
          If you turn on two-step verification, the secret for your
          authenticator app.

          Growatt&apos;s login uses), your inverter&apos;s serial number, your
          Octopus API key and account number, and when we last checked they
          work. The username, password and API key are encrypted before
          they&apos;re stored and are never shown again, not even to you.

        <li>
          <strong className="text-gray-100">Your settings:</strong> your charge
          window and whether it&apos;s used, charge power, battery stop level

          changed, and why the last check failed, if it did. We keep these so we
          only change your inverter when your plan changes.

          <strong className="text-gray-100">An activity log:</strong> a record
          of important actions on your account, with the time and the IP address
          they came from: changing your password, turning two-step verification
          on or off, saving, removing or failing to verify your Growatt or
          Octopus details, saving settings, changes sent to your inverter,
          saving sessions you join, automatic charging checks that changed your
          inverter, started failing or started working again, and downloads of
          your data. It never contains passwords or keys.

        <li>
          <strong className="text-gray-100">Technical data:</strong> to stop
          abuse, we count requests per IP address and per account. The counters
          hold a one-way hash, not the address itself, and are deleted within a
          day. Our hosting providers also log requests, including IP addresses,
          for a short time.

      <p>
        To show your dashboard and plan charging, the app also fetches your
        inverter&apos;s charge settings from Growatt and your planned charging
        times and saving sessions from Octopus. With automatic charging on, it
        fetches your planned charging times every 5 minutes. These are fetched
        when needed and not stored, apart from what the activity log and the
        automatic charging status record.

        Growatt, Octopus and Google each have their own privacy policies for the
        data they hold about you. Some of our providers are based in the USA.
        Where your data leaves the UK, it&apos;s protected by the safeguards UK
        law requires, such as the UK–US Data Bridge or the UK&apos;s
        International Data Transfer Addendum. We may also disclose data if the
        law requires it.

    <LegalSection title="How we protect it">
      <p>
        Everything travels over HTTPS. Your Growatt and Octopus secrets are
        encrypted with AES-256, with the key kept apart from the database. Your
        browser never holds a token or a secret: you stay signed in with cookies
        that scripts can&apos;t read. The database can only be reached by our
        server, and each request can only reach its own user&apos;s data. You
        can add two-step verification in Settings.
